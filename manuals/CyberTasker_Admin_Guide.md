Welcome to the CyberTasker Administration Console documentation. This guide outlines the advanced features and responsibilities of an Operative with `admin` clearance.

## 1. System Initialization (The `install.php` Protocol)

When deploying CyberTasker to a new server grid, the database is initially empty. 
Navigating to the root directory will automatically trigger the `install.php` sequence.

### Zero-Config Auto-Lock
CyberTasker features a self-locking installation mechanism:
*   **First Run:** The installer detects an empty grid, creates the necessary SQLite/MySQL tables, injects the initial test user dataset, and generates the default `admin` account.
*   **Subsequent Runs:** Once the `users` table exists, the installer **locks itself**. If you attempt to access `install.php` again to force a database schema update, you **must** be actively logged in as an `admin`. 
*   If a standard user or an unauthenticated visitor hits the installer, they receive a severe `[ ACCESS DENIED ]` warning, protecting the database from malicious resets.

## 2. The Administration Console

Log in with your administrator credentials and click the **"TERMINAL"** (Admin) icon in the side navigation to access the master grid.

### 2.1 Operative Oversight (The Datagrid)
The main panel displays a paginated list of all registered Operatives.

*   **Promote / Downgrade:** You can forcefully alter the clearance level of any user. Promote a trusted `user` to `admin`, or downgrade a rogue `admin` back to standard `user` status.
*   **Reset Cypher (Password Reset):** If an Operative is locked out of their neural link, use the `RESET PWD` function. This will forcefully overwrite their password to the system default (`password`) and flag them to change it upon their next login.
*   **Erase (Account Termination):** The `ERASE` button permanently deletes the user's account, all of their directives, sub-routines, and attached files from the database. **This action cannot be undone.**

### 2.2 Bio-Lock (2FA) Management
Security is paramount. The Admin grid allows you to monitor the 2FA status of all personnel.
*   Users with active Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) will display a green `[2FA]` badge next to their role.
*   **Emergency Override:** If an Operative loses their authenticator device and their backup codes, an Admin can click the red **`2FA OFF`** button to forcefully disable the Bio-Lock for that specific user, allowing them to log in with just their password.

## 3. Global System Policies

At the bottom of the Administration Console, you have access to global environment variables.

### Strict Password Policy
By toggling the `Strict Password Policy` switch:
*   **Disabled (Default):** Operatives can use simple passwords (e.g., `password123`) for rapid testing and deployment.
*   **Enabled:** The system enforces cryptographic-grade security. All new passwords (during registration or profile updates) must be at least 8 characters long and contain a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.

## 4. Diagnostics & Maintenance

*   **Mail Logs & Development:** CyberTasker relies on PHP's `mail()` function for dispatching notifications (e.g., password reset tokens, 2FA fallback codes). For local testing or environments without a live SMTP server configured, developers can manually uncomment the logging function within `api/helpers/mail_helper.php`. When activated, this will write all email traffic to a local `mail_log.txt` file, which can then be inspected directly via the Admin Terminal to ensure the system is dispatching signals correctly.
