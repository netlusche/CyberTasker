# CyberTasker: Master Automated Test Plan v2.1.0

This plan outlines the end-to-end testing strategy for CyberTasker v2.1.0. The goal is to verify all functional requirements, multi-theming architecture, and OWASP-aligned security hardening using automated browser sessions and backend audits.

---

## 🔄 Test Lifecycle & Evolution [IMPORTANT]

**Before every major test execution run, the following audit must be performed:**
1. **Feature Gap Analysis**: Review the latest commits and the `USER STORIES.md` to identify any newly implemented functionalities.
2. **Suite Expansion**: All new features must have a corresponding test case (automated or manual) added to this Master Test Plan.
3. **Selector Audit**: Ensure new UI components use consistent `data-testid` attributes to maintain E2E stability.
4. **Linguistic Audit**: Review `manuals/TRANSLATION_GUIDELINES.md` to ensure any new terminology or thematic slang adopted in the UI has clear directives for translators.

*Testing is not a static event; the suite must evolve alongside the neural stream.*

---

## 🏗 Test Data Preparation

To execute the automated suites below effectively, the following isolated test data will be seeded programmatically via a standalone script (`tests/seed_test_data.php`):
- **User Personas**: Generate 1 Admin (`Admin_Alpha`), 5 Operatives with active 2FA (`Op_Beta`), and 100 baseline users for Admin pagination testing.
- **Directive Matrix**: Populate `Op_Beta` with 55 directives to trigger and test frontend pagination components.
- **Mail Capture Strategy**: Configure a mock SMTP endpoint (e.g., MailHog) or logging service to reliably capture and verify outbound token transmissions instantly.
- **Authenticator Seeds**: Pre-define valid TOTP secrets to programmatically assert validation code limits without manual authenticator input.
- **Automated Seeding**: The E2E suites assume these specific personas exist.

## 🛠 E2E Execution & Maintenance [STABILIZED]

To ensure reliable results and prevent regressions, follow these execution protocols:

### Execution Protocol
The E2E suite is designed for sequential execution to avoid SQLite database locking issues:
```bash
npx playwright test --workers=1
```
The system automatically handles environment startup via `start_local.sh`, managing both the PHP backend and Vite frontend.

### Stabilization Strategies (CI-Ready)
The suite has been hardened against "flakiness" using the following patterns:
1. **Durable Selectors**: Use `data-testid="modal-title"`, `data-testid="profile-btn"`, etc., instead of text-based regex to avoid localization or minor UI shifts breaking tests.
2. **Initialization Padding**: Login flows include explicit waits for `INITIALIZING SYSTEM...` to clear, ensuring React hydration is complete.
3. **Network Synchronization**: Critical actions use `page.waitForResponse` (e.g., verifying pagination) to align assertions with actual backend state.
4. **Environment Reset**: It is highly recommended to run the seed script before a full test pass to ensure a clean state:
   ```bash
   php api/seed_test_data.php
   ```

---

## 📋 test-suite-02: Directive Management (CRUD)

### TS-02.1: Initialize & Edit Directive
- **Scenario**: Create a task, modify priority/category via badges, and edit title inline.
- **Validation**: DB reflects changes; UI triggers "Confetti" on completion.

### TS-02.2: Cyber-Triage Sorting
- **Scenario**: Verify that "Overdue" tasks always appear at the top of the stream.
- **Validation**: Sorting logic respects the Triage Protocol (Status > Urgency > Priority).

### TS-02.3: Stream Pagination [AUTOMATED] (02-directive-management.spec.js)

### TS-03.4: Localization Completeness Check [AUTOMATED]
- **Scenario**: Run `npm run check-translations` from the command line.
- **Validation**: The internal python script parses `AuthController.php` to extract all allowed visual themes, asserting that each possesses a corresponding `theme_<id>` string in the English source. It then recursively traverses the English `translation.json` source-of-truth, ensuring every single key exists across all 18 other locale configurations. If any keys or theme descriptions are missing, the script halts with a precise index of missing identifiers.
