# CyberTasker
## Initial Admin Setup & Deep Directives Guide

Welcome, Operative. 

Your credentials have been accepted. You have been granted `admin` clearance level. This document serves as your initial briefing on managing the CyberTasker environment and handling Deep Directives.

### 1. Security Protocols
CyberTasker operates on a strict security paradigm. As the administrative node, your first priority is to establish a secure perimeter.
- Navigate to the **Admin Console** (accessible via the top header).
- Review the `STRICT_PASSWORD_POLICY` setting. Activating this will enforce high-entropy passwords for all new operatives.
- Periodically review the User Roster. Any unauthorized operatives must have their clearance revoked immediately.

### 2. Deep Directives (Tasks)
Deep Directives are the core operational units of CyberTasker. They allow operatives to track, manage, and execute complex operations.
- **Priority Levels:** Directives can be assigned priority (e.g., Low, Med, High). Focus on High priority directives to maximize XP yield.
- **Categories:** Organize directives into distinct operational categories (e.g., Cyberware, Surveillance, System).
- **Attachments (Uplinks & Files):** Deep Directives support complex data attachments. You can link external URLs (Uplinks) or upload secure files directly to the directive dossier.

### 3. File Uplink Protocol
This very document was securely transmitted to you via the File Uplink Protocol. 
- Files are encrypted and stored in the secure `uploads/` vault on the server layer.
- Ensure that the `uploads` directory possesses the correct read/write permissions at the OS level (755).
- Suspicious or unauthorized uploads should be purged via the server backend if they bypass the frontend validation matrix.

### 4. Customizing the Interface
You can interface with CyberTasker using various visual paradigms.
- Open your **Profile** to switch themes.
- Themes range from the classic 'Cyberpunk' and 'Matrix' terminal aesthetics to the elegant 'Renaissance' geometry. 
- The system will persistently remember your visual preference via local storage and database sync.
